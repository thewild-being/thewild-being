- 👋 Hi, I’m @thewild-being but you can call me Tom.
- 👀 I’m interested in innovation, I love to learn new things and to enlarge the way in which I see the world.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on my <a href="https://www.heirdom.art">startup</a>, and by doing so I fell in love with coding and building products. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to link up with interesting people, to discuss ideas, implementations, and ways in which I can bring some value to you.
